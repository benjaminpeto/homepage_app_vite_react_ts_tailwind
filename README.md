# 🎯  Goal

<aside>
💡 The goal is to create a static website that will serve as a **Dev Dashboard**. This website will be set as the Home screen of the default browser and will display notifications, calendars, weather and wave report, unread emails, Github mentions, and so on.

</aside>

The result will be a modern design with all the information necessary to start my 8 hours shift as a Frontend Developer.
